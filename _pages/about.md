I like spreadsheets... and I use them for everything. 

This is a very simple blog that will cover the basics and a few not-so-basic. Over time we'll cover how to work with clean datasets, weird datasets, and cover a few tricks. 

This blog is hosted on Github Pages using Jekyll. There are no ads, no tracking, no community, etc. If you're looking for a Google Sheets community, check out [/r/sheets](https://reddit.com/r/sheets) or maybe [the support forum](https://support.google.com/docs/threads?hl=en&thread_filter=(category:docs_sheets)) -- but use Reddit.
